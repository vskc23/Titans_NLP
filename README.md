This Repository is for submitting individual implemented algorithms and the associated predicted pos tag output file.

We have implemented three models for POS Tagging:
  1) Logistic Regression - 50% 
  2) Hidden Markov Model - 87%
  3) MultiLayer Perceptron (LSTM) - 87.9%
      * RNN - 86.2%
      * GRU - 88.1%
      * Bidirectional LSTM - 88.2%

Even though MLP models have higher accuracy, HMM seems to perform better when the results were compared. 
So, please consider this HMM's labeled test file for evaluation - https://github.com/vskc23/Titans_NLP/blob/main/titans.test.txt
