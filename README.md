This Repository is for submitting individual implemented algorithms and the associated predicted pos tag output file.

We have implemented three models for POS Tagging:
  1) Logistic Regression - 50% 
  2) Hidden Markov Model - 87%
  3) MultiLayer Perceptron - 92%

Please consider this MLP's labeled test file for evaluation - https://github.com/vskc23/Titans_NLP/blob/main/Multi_Layer_Perceptron/output_final.txt.txt
