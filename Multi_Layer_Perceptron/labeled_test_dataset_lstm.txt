A in

by vbn
the nns

Robert in

formerly nns

at nns

Essentially jj
, in
Mr. in

had nn
invested cd
heavily in
in dt
the dt
Beatrice in

when prp
he in
was vbd
told cd

`` vbd

that dt

After nn

Mr. in

who in

Mr. in

asked nn
Mr. in

who jj
his nn

, in
on in
hearing in

it in

Lasker in

responded in
: in
`` in
Well in

your vbd

'' prp

The dt
illegal nnp
`` vbd

'' cc
of dt
the dt

was in
then jj
largely in
a in
confirmation cc

already nn
known in

many in
in dt
the cd

Had nn
the dt
case jj
gone nns

the dt

issues nn

have prp
surfaced nnp
: in

Was in
there nns
a in
fiduciary in
breach jj
in in
order nns
to in
obtain vbd
personal nn
gain nns

Did nn
Mr. in

have prp
notice nnp
of cc
this nnp
? in

Finally nnp
, in
was in
the in
information nn
material nn
? in

Yet rb
, in
all nn
these vbd
issues nn
are md
subsidiary jj
to in
a in
more cd
central nns
issue vbn
: in
Who jj
is nn
and pos
who jj
should nn
be nn
making vbn
the dt
criminal dt

here nnp
? in

It in
is nn
not md
my jj
contention ''
that cd
either in
Mr. nns
Chestman nn
or in
Mr. nns
Freeman in
was in
an cc
innocent cc
victim nn
of cc
prosecutorial cc
overzealousness cc

Arguably in
, rb
both vbd
were in
on nnp
notice nnp
that nnp
their vbd
behavior in
was vbp
at jj
least jj
risky dt
. nn

But vbz
even nn
if nn
they vbz
behaved nn
recklessly in
, in
reasons nn
still nn
exist in
to in
fear pos
and nnp
resist nnp
this nnp
steady cc
process nnp
of vbz
case-by-case nn
judicial cc
extension cc
of jj
the cc
law cc
of nnp

Courts nn
and pos

make vbd
decisions in
in nns
very nnp
different in
ways pos

are jjr
each in
susceptible nns
to in
very nns
different cc
kinds cc
of to
errors to
. to

After-the-fact rb
judicial rb
examination cc
of rb
an nns
actor ``
's jj
conduct dt
has nn
always dt
been dt
the dt
common jj
law ``

method dt

When cd
only prp
civil nnp
liability vbd

involved nnp
, in
this in
method nnp
has nnp
the dt
undeniable cc
strengths nnp
of cc
factual dt
specificity nn
and cc
avoidance cc
of cc
overgeneralization nn
. nn

Still nn
, in
case-by-case nn
retrospective jj
decision nn
making cc
of cc
this nnp
sort nn
is nn
vulnerable dt
to in
the cd
tunnel cd
vision in

by in
a in
fixation in
on nns
ad nns

-LRB- jj
and nn
usually to

examples nn
. <PAD>

When cd
a in
court in
decides ''
that in
a in
particular nns
actor ``
's jj
conduct in
was pos
culpable nn
and dt
so jj
extends nn
the nns
definition nnp
of nnp

reach in
this in

, in
it vbn
does vbn
not nn
see jj
the nn
potentially cc
enormous jj

that cd

Thus nn

For $

to in
make vbd

In in

Today vbd

both rb

In in

the dt

-LRB- jj

Before in

Although nn

the dt

At vbp

In in

Yet rb
